# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

New to OpenRPC? Youâ€™re in the right place. Letâ€™s start with the big picture.

**OpenRPC is an interface description for JSON-RPC**. It is both human and machine-readable.

Use cases for machine-readable JSON-RPC API definition documents include, but are not limited to:

- specification driven development
- interactive documentation
- code generation 
  - documentation
  - clients
  - servers
- automation of test cases

OpenRPC documents describe a JSON-RPC APIs services and are represented in JSON format. These documents may either be produced and served statically or be generated dynamically from an application.

The OpenRPC Specification does not require rewriting existing JSON-RPC APIs. It does not require binding any software to a service â€” the service being described may not even be owned by the creator of its description. It does, however, require the capabilities of the service be described in the structure of the OpenRPC Specification. Not all services can be described by OpenRPC â€” this specification is not intended to cover REST APIs - It is exclusively for APIs which adhere to the JSON-RPC 2.0 spec. The OpenRPC Specification does not mandate a specific development process such as design-first or code-first. It does facilitate either technique by establishing clear interactions with a JSON-RPC API.

**Right now, thousands of developers all over the world are building applications on Blockchchains that use JSON-RPC, and inventing new kinds of applications, many of which can benefit from OpenRPC today:**
