# Developer Resources

<div class="featured">Guides, resources, and tools for developers building on OpenRPC.</div>

## Getting started

**If you’re new to developing with OpenRPC, you’re in the right place.** These guides written by the OpenRPC community will introduce you to the basics of OpenRPC and introduce core concepts that might be different from other API development you’re familiar with.

Need a more basic non-technical primer first? Check out [open-rpc.org/learn.](/learn/)

## Resources

### Specification

The specification for OpenRPC. A programming language and transport agnostic interface description for JSON-RPC 2.0 APIs.

[https://spec.open-rpc.org/](https://spec.open-rpc.org/)

[https://github.com/open-rpc/spec](https://github.com/open-rpc/spec)

### `playground`

The OpenRPC playground a web IDE for developers to write their open-api based documents.

[https://playground.open-rpc.org/](https://playground.open-rpc.org/)

[https://github.com/open-rpc/playground](https://github.com/open-rpc/playground)

### `examples`

This resource provides example open-rpc documents. Put one through the generator-client or playground!

[https://github.com/open-rpc/examples](https://github.com/open-rpc/examples)

### `generator-client`

The generator client is a tool to build clients by simply passing an open-rpc document.

[https://github.com/open-rpc/generator-client](https://github.com/open-rpc/generator-client)

### `mock-server`

Provides a mock JSON-RPC API with Service Discovery for a given OpenRPC document.

[https://github.com/open-rpc/mock-server](https://github.com/open-rpc/mock-server)


### `meta-schema`

JSON Schema representation of the OpenRPC Specification.

[https://github.com/open-rpc/meta-schema](https://github.com/open-rpc/meta-schema)


### `server-js`

JSON-RPC 2.0 Server implementation that supports multiple transport protocols.

[https://github.com/open-rpc/server-js](https://github.com/open-rpc/server-js)

### `client-js`

A browser-compatible JSON-RPC client with multiple transports.

[https://github.com/open-rpc/client-js](https://github.com/open-rpc/client-js)

### `typings`

CLI and Javascript/Typescript methods for generating types for your OpenRPC API.

[https://github.com/open-rpc/typings](https://github.com/open-rpc/typings)

### `schema-utils-js`

Javascript utils for OpenRPC.

[https://github.com/open-rpc/schema-utils-js](https://github.com/open-rpc/schema-utils-js)
